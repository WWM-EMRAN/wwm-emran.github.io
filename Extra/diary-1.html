                      <h3>Life and loss</h3>
                        <p>
                            We think we are free! We can do whatever we want. Actually, we pretend to be independent; we pretend to be free.
                            We have become the slaves of our desires, the servants of our choices; and we know this is a losing deal. If we choose not to use the other eye when we have them both, one is not enough to see everything at once.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The loss is that we are breaking our existence with our own breaths. We always think that we are getting seasoned, experienced, and veterans.
                            Yes, we are, but if we ever stop at any moment and just wink at the time; we'll see it is counting itself down. When we see the countdown, we can see how fast it comes down to zero, to its origin. We are getting older and gaining age, but we are losing our lives.
                            The depletion is that we gain something, but we don't even realise what we lost to achieve that.
                            Gaining never makes us full.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A beautiful flower has fragrances, eye-catching colours, and pure freshness; but if you ask it, it will say, "I'm in a scarcity of lights; my beauty can't be seen in the dark.". The blazing sun has lights but is deficient in alluring fragrances. The beautiful moon doesn't have beautiful colours. There, you will find out what the loss is.
                            Ask kids, and they will tell you, "I have the innocence but not the strength of youth.". Ask young people, and they will tell you, "I have the excitement and enthusiasm but haven't the wisdom as old.".
                            Ask the elders, and they will tell you; "What to do, I have the wisdom but don't have the same joy that I felt in childhood. In those days, watching the frogs jump would give so much joy that shows nowadays don't give. I didn't have the fear of getting burned those days, used to tease the fire but was peeved with intense lights these days. I used to cry for no reason, but tears have become perky these days. Now we are trying to reach the moon, but there was a time when we used to be the moons. The paper boats, the rains, and the scene... we wished...",
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Take the wealth and the fame, also, take my youth...
                            <br>
                            give me back my childhood, the rain, and the paper boat..."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And in the end, you will see, what the real loss is.
                        </p>
                  </div>

                  <div id="test1" class="">
                      <img src="/assets/img/services.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid services-img">
                      <h3>Test1</h3>
                        <p>
                            We think we are free, unbound, able to do whatever we desire. Yet, this notion is an illusion, a shadow we chase. We wear the guise of independence while shackled to our desires, servants to our own choices. Deep down, we know this is a losing bargain. To have two eyes yet choose to see with only one—how could we ever perceive the entirety of existence? One eye alone cannot hold the full truth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The real loss lies in how we dismantle our being with each breath we take. We convince ourselves we are growing, becoming seasoned, experienced, and wise. And perhaps we are. Yet, if we paused for a fleeting moment and glanced at the clock of life, we would see it counting itself down. Time, relentless and unyielding, ticks toward its origin, zero. We age and gain years, yet with each step forward, we lose life itself.
                            This is the depletion we rarely acknowledge: in every gain, there is an unnoticed loss. In pursuit of fullness, we remain perpetually incomplete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A flower blooms in vibrant hues and exudes sweet fragrance, yet if it could speak, it might whisper, "I lack the light to reveal my beauty in the dark." The blazing sun illuminates all but lacks the delicacy of a sweet scent. The moon, so radiant and serene, knows not the joy of vivid colors. Each carries its own beauty and its own deficiency.
                            Ask a child, and they will say, "I have innocence but not the strength of youth." Ask the young, and they will say, "I have boundless energy and enthusiasm but lack the wisdom of age." Turn to the elders, and they will lament, "I have wisdom now, but the joy of childhood has escaped me. Once, watching frogs leap filled me with a happiness that no spectacle today can rival. Once, I teased the fire without fear of being burned, but now even its light is too harsh for my eyes. My tears flowed freely, unbidden, but now they resist, weighed down by pride and weariness.
                            We reach for the moon today, but there was a time when we were the moons—radiant with promise. Paper boats danced in the rain, carrying dreams, untethered by ambition. Those were the days we wished for."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And they will sigh:
                            "Take the wealth, take the fame, take even my youth— <br>
                            But return to me my childhood, the rain, the paper boats..."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we see it clearly: the real loss is not in what we failed to gain but in what we let slip away, unnoticed, as we reached for something else.
                        </p>
                  </div>

                  <div id="test2" class="">
                      <img src="/assets/img/services.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid services-img">
                      <h3>Test2</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe ourselves to be free—able to do whatever we wish. Yet, this belief is but a façade. We wear the mask of independence while tethered to our desires, enslaved by the very choices we claim as our own. Deep within, we know this is a losing bargain. To possess two eyes yet choose to see with only one is to blind ourselves to the fullness of existence; one eye alone cannot behold the entirety of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The true loss lies in how we diminish our essence with every breath we take. We tell ourselves we are growing—becoming seasoned, experienced, wise. And so we are. But if we paused, even for a fleeting moment, to glance at time, we would see its relentless countdown. In seeing this, we would grasp how swiftly it dwindles, rushing toward its origin—zero. While we add years to our lives, we subtract life from our years.
                            This is the great deficiency: in every gain, there is a hidden loss, often unnoticed, unexamined. We reach for one thing and forfeit another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A flower blooms with captivating colors and enchanting fragrance, but if you asked it, it might say, "I thirst for light; my beauty fades into obscurity in the dark." The blazing sun radiates light, yet lacks the gentle allure of fragrance. The moon, ethereal in its glow, knows not the joy of vivid color. And so, the loss is always present—a silent companion to every gift.
                            Ask a child, and they will say, "I have innocence, but not the strength of youth." Ask the young, and they will say, "I have energy and passion, but not the wisdom of age." Turn to the elders, and they will lament, "I have wisdom, yes, but not the joy of youth. Once, the leap of a frog could fill my heart with wonder, but now even grand spectacles fail to stir such delight. I once played with fire without fear, but now, I shun its glare. Tears used to flow freely, without reason, but now they cling stubbornly, reluctant to fall. We strive to reach the moon, yet once upon a time, we were the moons—radiant and full of promise. The paper boats, the rain, the innocence of those moments... Oh, how we wished."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Take the wealth, the fame, take even my youth—<br>
                            But give me back my childhood, the rain, the paper boats..."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And there, in that quiet yearning, lies the truth. The real loss is not in what we gain but in what we let slip away, unnoticed, as we pursue it.
                        </p>
